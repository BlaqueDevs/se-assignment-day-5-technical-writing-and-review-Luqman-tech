      -Step 3: Configuring Settings
9.Avoid Overloading with Information
   -Best Practice: Avoid cramming too much information into a single heading or subheading. If a section is complex, consider breaking it down further with additional subheadings.
   -Example: Instead of "Advanced Data Analytics Techniques and Their Applications in Business," break it into "Advanced Data Analytics Techniques" and "Applications in Business."
10.Use Headings as a Roadmap
   -Best Practice: Think of headings and subheadings as a roadmap for your document. They should guide the reader through the content, highlighting key sections and making it easy to navigate.
   -Example: In a report, headings like "Executive Summary," "Introduction," "Key Findings," and "Recommendations" give readers a clear sense of the document's structure and content.
11.Consider Accessibility
   -Best Practice: Ensure that headings and subheadings are accessible to all readers, including those using screen readers. Use proper HTML tags (e.g., `<h1>`, `<h2>`) in digital documents to indicate heading levels.
   -Example: In a web document, correctly tagging headings ensures that screen readers can navigate the document effectively, improving accessibility for visually impaired users.
12.Test for Readability
   -Best Practice: After drafting your headings and subheadings, review them to ensure they are easy to read and understand. Consider testing them with a sample audience to gauge their effectiveness.
   -Example: If a heading like "Operational Efficiency Enhancements" seems too complex, you might simplify it to "Improving Operational Efficiency" based on feedback.
